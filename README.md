# TextyBasedGame
Like NetHack but I made it
--------------------------
This is a text based game inspired by nethack and Rogue. It's meant to be a classic dungeon crawler just like it's predecessors.

Goals
-----
Goal 1: Create a window that displays the game. 

Goal 2: Make a player that can be moved around the map and that can be stopped by walls.
